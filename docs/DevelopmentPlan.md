**Rationale for Proceeding to Phase 6:**
- All core functionality working and validated in production environment
- Mock DLL proven reliable through E2E testing
- Additional test coverage represents polish rather than blocking issues
- Native development can proceed with current test suite as baseline

## Known Issues & Blockers

### Current Blockers
None - system ready for native layer development

### Technical Debt
1. **Utils Test Coverage** - **Priority:** Low - **Plan:** Defer to post-Phase 6
   - Current: 3/23 tests (13% coverage)
   - Impact: Low - all Utils functions validated through integration testing
   - Action: Document as future enhancement
   
2. **StepTraceInformation Tests** - **Priority:** Low - **Plan:** Defer to Phase 7
   - Integration-level testing deferred
   - Manual validation completed in Simio environment
   - Action: Formal test suite during E2E integration phase
